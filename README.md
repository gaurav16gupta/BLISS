## Abstract

Representation learning has transformed the problem of information retrieval into one of finding the approximate set of nearest neighbors in a high dimensional vector space. With limited hardware resources and time-critical queries, the retrieval engines face an inherent tension between latency, accuracy, scalability, compactness, and the ability to load balance in distributed settings. To improve the trade-off, we propose a new algorithm, called BaLanced Index for Scalable Search (BLISS), a highly tunable indexing algorithm with enviably small index sizes, making it easy to scale
to billions of vectors. It iteratively refines partitions of items by learning the relevant buckets directly from the query-item relevance data. To ensure that the buckets are balanced, BLISS uses the power-of-ùêæ choices strategy. We show that BLISS provides superior load balancing with high probability (and under very benign assumptions). Due to its design, BLISS can be employed for both near-neighbor retrieval (ANN problem) and extreme classification
(XML problem). For the case of ANN, we train and index 4 datasets with billion vectors each. We compare the recall, inference time, indexing time, and index size for BLISS with the two most popular and well-optimized libraries- Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph and Facebook‚Äôs FAISS. BLISS requires 100√ó lesser RAM than HNSW, making it fit in memory on commodity machines while taking a similar inference time as HNSW for the same recall. Against FAISS-IVF, BLISS achieves similar performance with 3-4√ó less memory requirement. BLISS is both data and model parallel, making it ideal for distributed implementation for training and inference. For the case of XML, BLISS surpasses the best baselines‚Äô precision while being 5√ó faster for inference on popular multi-label datasets with half a million classes.
